# Decoy

Python program that was created to mitigate damages caused by laptop and computer theft which often lead to personal information being exposed. Due to Google Chrome's password autosave feature, we have reason to believe that unauthorized accessors would instinctively open a browser such as Google Chrome to access personal information. To combat this, Decoy conceals itself as a web browser in plain sight in the hopes of catching unauthorized usage.
